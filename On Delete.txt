Here we find that on the delete of emp_id of 102
all the rows who were attached to this emp_id, 
are showing NULL. 
This is what we wanted and that is why while creating the tables on this
database we had mentioned " ON DELETE SET NULL ".

SELECT * FROM employee;

/*
Here in branch_supplier table we find that the branch_id = 2
are no more in the table when we deleted branch_id =2 from branch table
this is cause of "ON DELETE CASCADE" metioned while creating the branch
table in the database.
Again we can see that the client table or employee table showing NULL where
branch_id was 2.
This is because in these tables branch_id is a foreign key while in case branch
and branch_supplier tables branch_id is the primary key.
